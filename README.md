# Hopkins-Film-School
The following application is a registration form for the Hopkin's Film School. Users will be able to enter their personal information (name/email/DOB/status) and then they will be able to choose their classes. From there, users will proceed to their payment options. After they are done, users will be able to save their form which will then be reviewed by the school. If any information is wrong and/or not needed, users will be able to also clear the form completely and start over. There is also an about tab that users can use for more information regarding the application. When everything is complete and submitted, users will then be able to exit the program.
